comment: "Hi there! It looks like you're looking for Protoss builds. Did you know there is an incredibly helpful link up in the header and over in the sidebar to our [Build of the Week archive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CxAiv5lcPCT4pIZfZe91l8ZDGTKTGnlPaiMDTmfpPeU/edit)? There you will find every featured BOTW sorted by match-up and coded by Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced difficulty. If you don't find what you're looking for there, or have questions about a specific build, don't hesitate to ask. Hope this helps!"
